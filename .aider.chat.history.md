A quiz that allows someone to find out which animal (cat, dog, fox, hamster, horse) they are most similar to by answering 5 multiple choice questions and be able to share result. Generate an image for each animal in a cute cartoon vector style and display it on the result page. Allow the user to retake the quiz as many times as they want. Write the questions and answers yourself. Randomize the order of the answers for each question.

Place the quiz on the home page.

The following files in your repository will need to be added or edited to implement the quiz, generate the animal images, update the app logo, and change the metadata:

1. `mini-app/app/page.tsx` – add the quiz component and result display logic.  
2. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – update the `title` and `description` exported values.  
3. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – create a new todo file for the app logo.  
4. `mini-app/public/cat.png.todo` – create a new todo file for the cat image.  
5. `mini-app/public/dog.png.todo` – create a new todo file for the dog image.  
6. `mini-app/public/fox.png.todo` – create a new todo file for the fox image.  
7. `mini-app/public/hamster.png.todo` – create a new todo file for the hamster image.  
8. `mini-app/public/horse.png.todo` – create a new todo file for the horse image.  
9. `mini-app/components/quiz.tsx` – new component that implements the quiz logic.  
10. `mini-app/components/quiz-result.tsx` – new component that displays the result and share button.  

Please add these files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for each.
